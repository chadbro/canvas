# Bulk Add LTI To Courses

This script takes a csv file with one header `canvas_course_id` that contains the course id to have different APPs (LTIs) added in bulk. The other headers (`name`,`consumer_key`, `shared_secret` and `config_url`) are the configuration information of the LTI.

Please see the `example.csv` as a template to structure your CSV file.
